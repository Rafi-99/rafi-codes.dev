# Rafi Codes | Portfolio

## About
This repository hosts the source code for my website, [rafi-codes.dev](https://www.rafi-codes.dev). I built this
project using the Next.js React framework. This is the second iteration of my portfolio. Version 1.0 can be found
[here](https://github.com/Rafi-99/Portfolio-Website).

## How It Works
* This codebase is a monorepo that contains both the front-end and back-end of my site
* Front-end: Next.js
* Back-end: Next.js + MongoDB
* Page routing is handled by Next.js through the <code>src/pages</code> directory
* About Me page pulls the latest information from the database on each request, thanks to Next.js SSR
* Contact Me page uses Nodemailer + Google APIs to send form data to my email via an API route on my site
* Cool 3D animations are provided with the Three.js library
* All other animations are implemented with CSS
* Will update this accordingly!
